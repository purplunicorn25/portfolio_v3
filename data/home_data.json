Yet, music was a relief to me, and I could not imagine losing that over financial needs.</p><p>I asked myself what I could make instead. Fashion was my answer. I believed – and still believe – that clothes are wearable art with an ability to be loved in ways other art forms cannot.</p><p class='subheading'>A fashion designer?</p><p>I pursued this avenue past CEGEP until my experience at the École Supérieur de Mode suggested that to sell my designs I had to sustain a persona; that creation and marketing were intertwined more than I knew.</p><p>I had this idea to attend St Martins in London for their master's in fashion history. Because if now fashion design was not in line with my aspirations, I still found its history fascinating. But, I needed an undergraduate diploma.</p><p class='subheading'>An e-fashion designer?</p><p>Luckily, the summer before I enrolled at ESM, I won this training opportunity by volunteering at Vestech Pro research center. They taught me about intelligent fashion garments and their potential. They brought us to Concordia's Textile and Materiality Labs and introduced the Computation Arts Specialization.</p><p>The degree I was introduced to at Concordia was the bridge I needed. It allowed me to keep in touch with fashion design and technology. I joined the Art History Minor and focused on classes where I could research and learn about fashion and textile history.</p><p class='subheading'>A digital designer?</p><p>I did not expect to find programming and logical gates that attractive. I never thought I would regret not taking mathematics in CEGEP, but here I was. I liked the potential of digital artifacts and their interactivity. I loved how fashion was interactive, but the array of experiences I could create with code was so wide I could not resist.</p><p>So, I dived in. I discovered various technologies and found myself in procedural texturing and WEBGL environments. It felt like I had unlocked new powers within myself.</p><p class='subheading'>Hello screentime?</p><p>What I dislike most about digital creation is that blue light burns my eyes and makes my head ache, not to mention posture.</p><p class='subheading'>A UX designer?</p><p>For my last year as a student, I discovered that UX design had the potential to satisfy both my love for interaction and logic gates, but, moreover, to put my 10 years of experience in customer service to use.</p><p>I am at ease with the public and like to understand the needs of others to provide help and solutions. I suspect that UX will provide new opportunities to learn about user needs and realities I never encountered. It should keep me creative and curious.</p><p class='subheading'>A UX designer.</p><p class='ps'><i>Post-criptum:<br>I was not only a student and will not only be an employee in this life. I pride myself in being these things too: a martial artist, a ballet dancer, a video game player, a weaver, a foodie, a traveler, a knitter, a bonsai enthusiast, a sister, a girlfriend, a daughter, and a caring friend.</i></p>"
